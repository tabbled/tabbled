## 🧩 What was Tabbled?

**Tabbled** was a low-code data platform designed for fast creation of structured reports, dashboards, and internal tools.

It provided:
- A dynamic table designer with expressions and formatting
- Plugin architecture for custom logic (both frontend and backend)
- Integration with PostgreSQL as the main data source
- Role-based access control and flexible authentication (including OpenID)
- Embeddable views and component-based layout engine

Tabbled was actively used in production setups with high data throughput (20–30 params/sec), dynamic reports, and flexible user roles.

## 🤔 Why was it archived?

Tabbled went through 3 major internal iterations (most of them private) before this open-source version.  
While the platform proved useful in real projects, over time:

- Architectural complexity started to limit development speed
- Accumulated legacy slowed down innovation
- A major feature overhaul was needed — which pointed to starting fresh

Instead of retrofitting everything into the old codebase, a new system is now being built from scratch using lessons learned here.
